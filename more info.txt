The error is expected - there's no service running on port 80 on your machine. Your proxy is working correctly, it's just trying to connect to an upstream server that doesn't exist yet!

Here are a few ways to test your proxy:

## Option 1: Use a Simple HTTP Server

Start a simple Python HTTP server in another terminal:

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Start a simple HTTP server on port 8000
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then run your proxy to forward to it:
```bash
# Terminal 2 - Run your proxy
cargo run -- 0.0.0.0:8080 127.0.0.1:8000
```

Now you can test:
```bash
# Terminal 3 - Test the proxy
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Option 2: Proxy to a Public Server

Test by proxying to an external server:

```bash
cargo run -- 0.0.0.0:8080 example.com:80
```

Then test with:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Option 3: Use Netcat as Echo Server

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Simple echo server
nc -l 9000

# Terminal 2 - Run proxy
cargo run -- 0.0.0.0:8080 127.0.0.1:9000

# Terminal 3 - Test
telnet localhost 8080
```

## Quick Test with Real Service

If you have nginx or apache installed, start it first. Otherwise, the Python HTTP server (Option 1) is the easiest way to test your proxy quickly!

Your proxy code looks solid - it's using zero-copy transfers, SO_REUSEPORT, and CPU pinning. Once you have an upstream service running, you should see nice performance stats! 🚀
